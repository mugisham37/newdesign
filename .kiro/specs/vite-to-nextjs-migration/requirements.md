# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating an existing Vite.js React portfolio website to Next.js with TypeScript while maintaining 100% visual and functional fidelity. The current portfolio features advanced 3D graphics with Three.js, GSAP animations, custom Amiamie fonts, smooth scrolling with Lenis, and a responsive design. The migration must preserve every visual element, animation timing, and user interaction exactly as they currently exist.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Framework Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Vite.js to Next.js with TypeScript, so that I can benefit from Next.js features like SSR, better SEO, and improved performance while maintaining the exact same visual appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Next.js 14+ with App Router
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all JavaScript files SHALL be converted to TypeScript with proper type definitions
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the build system SHALL use Next.js instead of Vite
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing dependencies SHALL be preserved with identical versions
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL maintain the same development and build commands structure

### Requirement 2: Visual Fidelity Preservation

**User Story:** As a user visiting the portfolio, I want the migrated Next.js version to look exactly identical to the current Vite version, so that there are no visual differences or regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing the migrated site with the original THEN all visual elements SHALL be pixel-perfect identical
2. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN responsive breakpoints SHALL match exactly
3. WHEN fonts are rendered THEN the Amiamie font family SHALL display identically across all weights and styles
4. WHEN viewing colors and spacing THEN all Tailwind CSS classes SHALL produce identical visual results
5. WHEN inspecting layout THEN all component positioning and sizing SHALL remain unchanged
6. WHEN viewing the 3D planet THEN its appearance, lighting, and positioning SHALL be identical

### Requirement 3: Animation and Interaction Preservation

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the portfolio, I want all animations and interactions to work exactly the same as the current version, so that the user experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the loading progress animation SHALL function identically with the same timing
2. WHEN GSAP animations trigger THEN they SHALL have the same duration, easing, and visual effects
3. WHEN the 3D planet animates THEN its rotation, floating, and entrance animations SHALL be identical
4. WHEN scrolling through the site THEN Lenis smooth scrolling SHALL behave exactly the same
5. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN all hover states and transitions SHALL match
6. WHEN the page loads THEN the fade-in transition from loading to content SHALL be identical

### Requirement 4: Three.js 3D Graphics Preservation

**User Story:** As a user viewing the portfolio, I want the 3D planet and lighting effects to render exactly the same, so that the visual impact and performance remain unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 3D scene loads THEN the Planet.glb model SHALL render with identical appearance
2. WHEN viewing the planet THEN all materials, textures, and shading SHALL look the same
3. WHEN the scene renders THEN camera position, FOV, and near/far planes SHALL be identical
4. WHEN lighting is applied THEN all Lightformer configurations SHALL produce the same visual result
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the planet scaling SHALL adjust identically based on screen size
6. WHEN the scene loads THEN performance and frame rate SHALL be maintained or improved

### Requirement 5: Font System Migration

**User Story:** As a user reading the portfolio content, I want all typography to render exactly the same, so that the visual hierarchy and brand identity are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fonts load THEN all Amiamie font variants SHALL be available and render identically
2. WHEN text is displayed THEN font weights (300, 400, 900) SHALL appear exactly the same
3. WHEN text is styled THEN italic variants SHALL render identically
4. WHEN using Amiamie-Round fonts THEN they SHALL display with the same appearance
5. WHEN fonts load THEN the font-display: swap behavior SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN viewing responsive text THEN all custom utility classes SHALL produce identical sizing

### Requirement 6: Asset and Public File Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all assets to be properly migrated and accessible, so that images, models, and fonts load correctly in the Next.js environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assets are accessed THEN all files in the public directory SHALL be available at the same paths
2. WHEN the Planet.glb model loads THEN it SHALL be accessible from the same /models/ path
3. WHEN fonts are loaded THEN they SHALL be accessible from the same /fonts/ paths
4. WHEN project images are displayed THEN they SHALL load from the same /assets/ paths
5. WHEN background images are used THEN they SHALL be accessible from the same paths
6. WHEN the favicon loads THEN it SHALL use the same vite.svg file for compatibility

### Requirement 7: Component Architecture Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the code, I want the component structure to remain the same, so that the codebase is familiar and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the component structure THEN all existing components SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN components are converted THEN they SHALL maintain the same props and interfaces
3. WHEN hooks are used THEN useEffect, useRef, and custom hooks SHALL function identically
4. WHEN GSAP is integrated THEN useGSAP hooks SHALL work the same way
5. WHEN Three.js components render THEN useGLTF and other Drei hooks SHALL function identically
6. WHEN responsive behavior is needed THEN react-responsive SHALL work the same way

### Requirement 8: Loading and Performance Preservation

**User Story:** As a user waiting for the portfolio to load, I want the loading experience to be identical or better, so that perceived performance is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the loading progress indicator SHALL function identically
2. WHEN 3D assets load THEN the useProgress hook SHALL track loading the same way
3. WHEN the loading completes THEN the transition to content SHALL have the same timing
4. WHEN measuring performance THEN Lighthouse scores SHALL be maintained or improved
5. WHEN the site loads THEN First Contentful Paint SHALL be equal or better
6. WHEN 3D scenes render THEN frame rates SHALL be maintained at 60fps

### Requirement 9: Smooth Scrolling and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user navigating the portfolio, I want the scrolling behavior to feel exactly the same, so that the smooth, premium user experience is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling through the site THEN ReactLenis SHALL provide identical smooth scrolling
2. WHEN navigation links are clicked THEN scroll-to-section behavior SHALL work the same
3. WHEN on mobile devices THEN touch scrolling SHALL feel identical
4. WHEN scrolling speed changes THEN the momentum and easing SHALL match exactly
5. WHEN overflow is handled THEN overflow-x-auto behavior SHALL be preserved
6. WHEN scroll events trigger THEN any scroll-based animations SHALL work identically

### Requirement 10: Development and Build Process

**User Story:** As a developer working on the project, I want the development experience to be smooth and the build process to work reliably, so that productivity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running development mode THEN hot reloading SHALL work for all file types
2. WHEN building for production THEN the build SHALL complete successfully without errors
3. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN type checking SHALL pass without errors
4. WHEN linting is run THEN ESLint SHALL pass with the same or better standards
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN all packages SHALL be compatible with Next.js
6. WHEN deploying THEN the build output SHALL be optimized and functional
