# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves transforming an existing HTML/CSS/JS brutalist portfolio into a sophisticated Next.js 14 application featuring a dual-theme architecture. The portfolio showcases a developer's capabilities through an aggressive, high-impact design that seamlessly transitions between **Extreme Brutalist** (hard, raw aesthetic) and **Refined Brutalist** (professional, polished) themes based on scroll position and section context.

The current portfolio demonstrates exceptional design sophistication with complex layered animations, multiple shadow systems, particle effects, and intricate hover states. The transformation must preserve every design detail while leveraging Next.js superpowers for performance, SEO, and modern development practices.
