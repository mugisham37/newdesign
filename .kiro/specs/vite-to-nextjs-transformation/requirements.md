# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming a React + Vite portfolio project into a Next.js 14+ TypeScript application while maintaining the exact same visual design, functionality, and user experience. The current portfolio features sophisticated 3D animations, interactive components, custom Tailwind CSS styling, and modern React patterns that must be preserved during the transformation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Vite to Next.js with TypeScript, so that I can benefit from Next.js features like better SEO, performance optimizations, and TypeScript safety while maintaining all existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN the application SHALL use Next.js 14+ with App Router
2. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all components SHALL be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
3. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN the application SHALL compile without TypeScript errors
4. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically to the original Vite version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user visiting the portfolio, I want the visual design and animations to remain exactly the same, so that the user experience is not disrupted by the technical migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all visual elements SHALL appear identical to the original design
2. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all Three.js 3D animations SHALL function smoothly (astronaut model, globe interactions)
3. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all Motion/Framer Motion animations SHALL work as before
4. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all custom Tailwind CSS styles and animations SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN responsive design SHALL work on all screen sizes as before

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all interactive components to work properly in Next.js, so that user interactions like navigation, form submissions, and 3D model interactions continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the navigation menu THEN it SHALL function identically on both mobile and desktop
2. WHEN a user submits the contact form THEN EmailJS integration SHALL work and send emails successfully
3. WHEN a user interacts with the 3D globe THEN it SHALL respond to mouse/touch interactions as before
4. WHEN a user views the astronaut animation THEN it SHALL play smoothly with proper floating animation
5. WHEN a user interacts with any animated elements THEN all GSAP and Motion animations SHALL work properly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper client-side rendering for browser-dependent components, so that Three.js, animations, and interactive elements work correctly in Next.js SSR environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components use Three.js THEN they SHALL be marked as client-side components with "use client" directive
2. WHEN components use browser APIs THEN they SHALL be properly handled for SSR compatibility
3. WHEN components use hooks or state THEN they SHALL be marked as client-side components
4. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no hydration mismatches or SSR errors
5. WHEN components use motion animations THEN they SHALL be client-side rendered to avoid SSR issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to follow Next.js conventions, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN the project SHALL use the Next.js App Router structure
2. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all files SHALL be organized in appropriate Next.js directories (app/, components/, etc.)
3. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all JSX files SHALL be converted to TSX with proper TypeScript types
4. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN the project SHALL have proper Next.js configuration files
5. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all imports SHALL use correct Next.js import patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependencies to be compatible with Next.js, so that the application builds and runs without dependency conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all current dependencies SHALL be compatible with Next.js
2. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN Next.js and TypeScript dependencies SHALL be properly installed
3. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN Vite-specific dependencies SHALL be removed
4. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN package.json scripts SHALL be updated for Next.js commands
5. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all dependency versions SHALL be compatible with each other

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper asset handling in Next.js, so that all images, 3D models, and static assets load correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all assets in the public folder SHALL be accessible
2. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN 3D model files SHALL load properly in Three.js components
3. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN image assets SHALL be optimized using Next.js image optimization where appropriate
4. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN all asset paths SHALL work correctly in production builds
5. WHEN the transformation is complete THEN font loading SHALL work properly with Next.js font optimization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper build and development processes, so that I can develop and deploy the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running development mode THEN the application SHALL start with `npm run dev` and hot reload properly
2. WHEN building for production THEN the application SHALL build successfully with `npm run build`
3. WHEN running the production build THEN the application SHALL start with `npm run start`
4. WHEN linting the code THEN ESLint SHALL work with TypeScript and Next.js configurations
5. WHEN building THEN there SHALL be no build errors or warnings related to the transformation
